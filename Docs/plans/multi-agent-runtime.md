## Current Reality (verified 2026-05-25)

**Canonical local surface:** `/Users/user/Documents/Projects/remodex-build` on
`feat/multi-agent-runtime`. Treat `/Users/user/Documents/Projects/remodex` as a
historical/stale snapshot for this lane unless Kartik explicitly asks to inspect
it.

**Live tracker state:** Parent epic #16 is open. #17 is closed via PR #30.
#18 is closed as completed after 2026-05-25 reconciliation and bridge/relay
test proof. Foundational follow-ups #19-#29 remain open/gated, and the static
model-catalog pass #31-#37 is closed/superseded by dynamic provider/model issues
#38-#43.

**Verification run 2026-05-25:**
- `cd phodex-bridge && npm test` -> 448 pass, 0 fail.
- `cd relay && npm test` -> 39 pass, 0 fail.
- Not run in this audit: `xcodebuild`, physical iPhone smoke, physical iPad
  smoke.

**Immediate operating note:** the registry blocker has been reconciled and #18
is closed. The next delegable track is dynamic provider/model discovery in order:
#39 -> #40 -> #41 -> #42, with #43 kept human/device-gated until physical iPad
proof exists. Do not unblock upstream PR prep #29 without fresh iPhone/iPad
runtime proof.

## Prior Reality (as of stabilization work start, post user answers 2026)

**Brownfield state on this branch (hybrid partial impl + docs/plans ahead of full cutover):**
- Substantial real foundation present (bridge: full `agent-runtime-registry.js` + `agent-runtime-capabilities.js` + `canonical-events.js` + `thread-agent-state.js` + codex/opencode/cursor adapters + `opencode-server.js` (exact spawn + security per blueprint) + `cursor-acp-client.js` (robust discovery with local paths); iOS: `CodexService+RemodexEventAdapter.swift` wired in Incoming, `CodexThread` has `agentRuntime`/`agentSessionId`/`opencode*AgentName` fields + merge, `TurnComposerRuntimeState` + gating + Agent pill, `CodexServiceRemodexEventAdapterTests` + service descriptors; all per ADR 002/003 + implementation blueprint tables).
- **Gaps vs. locked decisions** (spawn audit + GitHub issues #16–#29 still OPEN/"blocked"): Codex-to-canonical not wired in prod paths (big-bang #19/#23 incomplete; raw `codex/event/*` dominant for Codex + sidecars); warm/cached initialize has stale "spawn support lands in a later update" fallbacks (even for Cursor with full ACP); fork/continue lacks runtime metadata inheritance (CodexService+ThreadFork + Helpers); permission/plan event mappings partial + iOS adapter "cursor" default bug; tests cover happy paths but not full matrix/warm/reconnect per AGENTS; resume not uniform.
- **GitHub issues** (kartikkabadi/remodex, via MCP): All slices #21–#29 OPEN, "enhancement"/"blocked"/"ready-for-human", bodies match plans 1:1 (acceptance requires agent verification + Kartik physical smoke). No slices closed yet. Local code has partial progress on many "suggested files".
- **Docs drift**: README heavily Codex-only (being stabilized in Phase 1 with CONTEXT terms + V1/partial/Core notes + links). Plans/ADRs use correct language. modelProvider still in legacy iOS models (kept separate per plans; not overloaded for Agent Runtime).
- **Cleanup debt**: 12 P0 god objects in Swift (CLEANUP-AUDIT May 11; many still TODO per TRACKER). Narrow scope: only intersecting files (CodexThread, Helpers, Incoming, ThreadFork, RemodexEventAdapter) in Phase 3.
- **Artifacts (user rules strictly followed)**: tmp-vps-live/ (Emanuele upstream live relay bits) fully protected — zero touch. cleanup/plans/ (270 local per-file plans) treated as user-local; no bulk action (narrow scope + "review details first... very selective... do not delete anything that belongs to Emanuele"). (Archived as "completed" for narrow 2026-05 pass per gates; high-level TRACKER remains; see active cleanup/TASK-TRACKER.md.)
- **User intent (ask_user_question answers)**: Hybrid (local partial as solo base + selective safe cherry-picks from Emanuele codex/add-* in parallel); narrow scope; push higher practical parity where safe/fixture-backed; keep selectively + extremely conservative on artifacts (nothing Emanuele-owned); actively update GitHub issues with reality/progress during work.

**Stabilization in progress (Phase 1 docs first, then 7 gaps per blueprint order, narrow intersecting cleanup, higher-parity polish).** See plan.md (session 019e5a13-...) + README updates for Reality vs. Plan. All work follows AGENTS.md guardrails (local-first, read this plan first, kartikkabadi issues, xcodebuild after Swift, no junk reports, preserve iOS timeline rules).

Do not merge upstream `modelProvider` router branches wholesale. Mine patterns; implement ADR shape.

---

## Goal

Remodex hosts multiple **agent runtimes** on the Mac (Codex, OpenCode, Cursor; Grok later). Each thread picks one runtime at creation. The bridge translates all runtimes into **one Remodex event vocabulary**; iOS uses **one** timeline pipeline.

Do not merge upstream `modelProvider` router branches wholesale. Mine patterns; implement ADR shape.

## Locked decisions (2026-05-23 grill)

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Routing | `agentRuntime` + `agentSessionId` — not `modelProvider` |
| Wire to phone | `remodex/event/*`, `plan.*`, permission RPC only in production |
| OpenCode | Spawn-only `opencode serve` on loopback |
| Cursor PR2 | **Core only** — hide queue, steer, photos on Cursor threads |
| PR1 Stretch | Hide controls if fixture tests fail; Core must work |
| OpenCode handoff | `desktop/continueOnOpenCode` via `opencode attach` |
| iOS cutover | Big-bang canonical in PR1 (bridge 03 + iOS 06 together) |
| Delivery | Three stacked upstream PRs: PR1 OpenCode → PR2 Cursor → PR3 iPad |
| QA | PR1/PR2 = iPhone (`CodexMobile`); PR3 = iPad (`RemodexPad`) |
| Telegram / Grok | Out of multi-agent V1 |
| Merge gate | `#17` CI must run real bridge + relay tests before merging `#18+` |
| Initialize contract | Warm reconnect returns full runtime payload, not `{ bridgeManaged: true }` only |
| iOS naming | **Agent Runtime** (transport) vs existing **Codex model runtime** types stay separate |
| Thread sync | Bridge `thread-agent-state.json` is source of truth; `thread/list` projects agent fields |
| Runtime models | Provider/model identity belongs to runtime-owned model discovery, not a static app catalog |

## Runtime model discovery addendum (2026-05-25)

Physical iPad smoke proved the first runtime-scoped model catalog pass was a useful tracer bullet but not the final product shape. OpenCode cannot be represented by two hardcoded model entries. Remodex must discover provider/model choices from the user's actual OpenCode setup, keep provider identity separate from model identity, and keep iPad turn state stable through OpenCode response gaps.

The superseded model-catalog issues are #31-#37. Replacement plan:

### Open issue reality (2026-05-25, for agents)

| Issue | Code reality | Blocker |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| #19, #23 | Partial — canonical layer exists; Codex paths still emit raw `codex/event/*` in places | Big-bang cutover not finished |
| #20, #22 | Partial — OpenCode spawn + adapter landed; dynamic models not wired | #39–#42 track |
| #21 | Partial — runtime pill + gating in iOS | E2E proof |
| #24, #27 | Not proven E2E | Kartik iPhone smoke |
| #25, #26 | Partial — Cursor ACP + adapter in bridge | E2E proof |
| #28, #43 | Not proven on iPad | Kartik iPad smoke |
| #29 | Not started for upstream PR | #24–#28 proof |
| #39–#42 | Not started / early | Delegable code track after #18 |
| #38 | PRD only | Parent for #39–#43 |

## Verification (agents)

- `cd phodex-bridge && npm test`
- `cd relay && npm test` (CI when added)
- `./run-local-remodex.sh` Mac smoke
- `xcodebuild` compile after iOS changes
- Kartik: physical iPhone (PR1/PR2) and iPad (PR3) smoke

Not required for agent "done": simulator QR E2E, full XCTest suite every commit.
