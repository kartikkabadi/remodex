**Status:** PR45 integration branch active (verified 2026-05-26)
**Branch:** `feat/multi-agent-runtime` on [kartikkabadi/remodex](https://github.com/kartikkabadi/remodex) from `origin/main`  
**Parent issue:** https://github.com/kartikkabadi/remodex/issues/16  
**Implementation blueprint:** [multi-agent-runtime-implementation.md](multi-agent-runtime-implementation.md)
**Domain language:** [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md)  
**Architecture:** [ADR 002](../adr/002-agent-runtime-and-canonical-events.md), [ADR 003](../adr/003-cursor-agent-runtime.md)

## Current Reality (verified 2026-05-26)

**Canonical local surface:** `/Users/user/Documents/Projects/remodex-build` on
`feat/multi-agent-runtime`. Treat `/Users/user/Documents/Projects/remodex` as a
historical/stale snapshot for this lane unless Kartik explicitly asks to inspect
it. Session bootstrap: [Docs/agents/README.md](../agents/README.md).

**Live tracker state:** Parent epic #16 is open. #17/#18 and #31-#37 are closed.
PR45 combines the fork-side OpenCode, Cursor, dynamic provider/model, and iPad
integration work. After PR45 lands, close or update the issues listed in
[Docs/agents/issue-tracker.md](../agents/issue-tracker.md); PR45 does not
auto-close them.

**Verification run after upstream sync:**
- `cd phodex-bridge && npm test` -> 475 pass, 0 fail.
- `cd relay && npm test` -> 41 pass, 0 fail.
- `xcodebuild` arm64 simulator compile -> `CodexMobile` succeeded; `RemodexPad`
  succeeded on an iPad simulator destination.
- Physical iPhone and iPad smoke remain human-gated.

**Immediate operating note:** do not start duplicate work for #39-#41; PR45
contains the code path. #42 still needs real running-turn proof tied to the
physical iPad smoke gate (#43). Do not unblock upstream PR prep #29 without
fresh iPhone/iPad runtime proof.

## Brownfield gaps (still accurate)

Foundation is in place (#18 closed). PR45 carries most fork-side implementation
work, but canonical cutover proof, E2E/device proof, and upstream handoff gates
are still tracked on GitHub. See [Docs/agents/issue-tracker.md](../agents/issue-tracker.md) for the live queue.

Do not merge upstream `modelProvider` router branches wholesale. Mine patterns; implement ADR shape.

---

## Goal

Remodex hosts multiple **agent runtimes** on the Mac (Codex, OpenCode, Cursor; Grok later). Each thread picks one runtime at creation. The bridge translates all runtimes into **one Remodex event vocabulary**; iOS uses **one** timeline pipeline.

Do not merge upstream `modelProvider` router branches wholesale. Mine patterns; implement ADR shape.

## Locked decisions (2026-05-23 grill)

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Routing | `agentRuntime` + `agentSessionId` — not `modelProvider` |
| Wire to phone | `remodex/event/*`, `plan.*`, permission RPC only in production |
| OpenCode | Spawn-only `opencode serve` on loopback |
| Cursor PR2 | **Core only** — hide queue, steer, photos on Cursor threads |
| PR1 Stretch | Hide controls if fixture tests fail; Core must work |
| OpenCode handoff | `desktop/continueOnOpenCode` via `opencode attach` |
| iOS cutover | Big-bang canonical in PR1 (bridge 03 + iOS 06 together) |
| Delivery | Three stacked upstream PRs: PR1 OpenCode → PR2 Cursor → PR3 iPad |
| QA | PR1/PR2 = iPhone (`CodexMobile`); PR3 = iPad (`RemodexPad`) |
| Telegram / Grok | Out of multi-agent V1 |
| Merge gate | `#17` CI must run real bridge + relay tests before merging `#18+` |
| Initialize contract | Warm reconnect returns full runtime payload, not `{ bridgeManaged: true }` only |
| iOS naming | **Agent Runtime** (transport) vs existing **Codex model runtime** types stay separate |
| Thread sync | Bridge `thread-agent-state.json` is source of truth; `thread/list` projects agent fields |
| Runtime models | Provider/model identity belongs to runtime-owned model discovery, not a static app catalog |

---

## Upstream PR map

PR45 is the fork integration branch, not the final upstream slicing plan. If
Kartik later wants upstream PRs, split from the landed fork work into:

| PR | Scope | Device QA |
|----|--------|-----------|
| **PR1 — OpenCode** | Registry, canonical, OpenCode path, iOS UX + cutover, iPhone E2E | Kartik iPhone |
| **PR2 — Cursor** | Cursor ACP + adapter, iPhone E2E (Core only) | Kartik iPhone |
| **PR3 — iPad** | RemodexPad target/build wiring and pad smoke | Kartik iPad |

## Runtime model discovery addendum (2026-05-25)

Physical iPad smoke proved the first runtime-scoped model catalog pass was a useful tracer bullet but not the final product shape. OpenCode cannot be represented by two hardcoded model entries. Remodex must discover provider/model choices from the user's actual OpenCode setup, keep provider identity separate from model identity, and keep iPad turn state stable through OpenCode response gaps.

The superseded model-catalog issues are #31-#37. Replacement plan:

### Open issue reality (2026-05-26, for agents)

| Issue | Code reality | Blocker |

| #19, #23 | Partial — canonical layer exists; some Codex/iOS paths still handle raw `codex/event/*` | Big-bang cutover proof not finished |
| #20, #22 | Code-complete candidate in PR45 | Close after PR45 lands with bridge/OpenCode proof |
| #21 | Code-complete candidate in PR45 | Close after PR45 lands with iOS runtime UX proof |

| #25, #26 | Code-complete candidate in PR45 | Close after PR45 lands with Cursor adapter proof |
| #28, #43 | Not proven on iPad | Kartik iPad smoke |
| #29 | Not started for upstream PR | #24–#28 proof |
| #39–#41 | Code-complete candidate in PR45 | Close after PR45 lands with dynamic model proof |
| #42 | Code-progress in PR45 | Keep open until running-turn gap proof via #43 |
| #38 | PRD parent | Keep open until #39–#43 are resolved |

## Verification (agents)

- `cd phodex-bridge && npm test`
- `cd relay && npm test` (CI when added)
- `./run-local-remodex.sh` Mac smoke
- `xcodebuild` compile after iOS changes
- Kartik: physical iPhone (PR1/PR2) and iPad (PR3) smoke

Not required for agent "done": simulator QR E2E, full XCTest suite every commit.
